                <d1>Hi! I'm a San Francisco-based designer living at the intersection of storytelling and experience.</d1>
                <br></br>
                <p>My work highlights user experience, industrial design, graphic design, and animation, using a combination of traditional processes and filmmaking to offer a unique approach to my designs. Plus, I know some dev essentials (I coded this website with my own two hands!). In other news, I’m a big movie nerd, and will always take you up an offer to play a boardgame.</p>
